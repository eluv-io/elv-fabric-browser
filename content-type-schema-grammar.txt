#### Type Schema Grammar:

* **Schema**: [ **Entry** ]
* **Entry**: { **Key**, **Type**, { **Options** } }
* **Key**: string
* **Type**:
  "label" |
  "string" |
  "text" |
  "integer" |
  "number" |
  "json" |
  "boolean" |
  "choice" |
  "list" |
  "object" |
  "file" |
  "attachedFile"
* **Options** - Each type may have additional options that can modify contents, display properties, or validation of the field
  - \*
    - label: string
      - The label for this field. If not set, the key will be used as the label
    - required: boolean
      - Whether or not this field is required. Validation will be performed on the form
         using the html5 "required" attribute
  - "label":
    - text: string
      - The text to be displayed in the label
  - "object":
    - fields: **Schema**
      - The fields of an object are described as a schema
    - flattenDisplay: boolean
      - If true, the fields will not be wrapped in a subsection in the form with the object label -- the fields will appear as if they were not contained in an object.
  - "choice":
    - options: [ [label, value], ...]
      - List of options to choose from. Each entry is a pair consisting of the label of the entry and its value
  - "file":
    - multiple: boolean
      - If specified, will allow uploading of multiple files. Otherwise, only a single file will
         be allowed
    - accept: mime-type-string | [ mime-type-string ]
      - Limits the allowed filetypes to be upload to the specified mime-types
    - preview: boolean
      - If specified, a preview of the selected image will be shown above the selection when an image is chosen
      - "accept" should be an image type. If multiple inputs are allowed, only the first selection will be shown
  - "attachedFile":
    - hash: string
      - The hash of the content type part corresponding to the attached file
    - filename: string
      - The filename to use when the file is downloaded. If not provided, the label or the key will be used.
